# All-Terrian Camera

If you watch this video about a [bladeless dyson style of propulusion unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2UCK3pCFjk), 
it has a Quad Copter design of jets, with one pump, that should work with Air or Water,
giving us an All-Terrian Camera, but on land, you need wheels, so you can use the pump moter,
but not the pump.

It might be impractical to try to make a pump work with either Air or Water, 
the two designs would mean that you cannot use Water to cool a water pump, 
or air to cool an air pump, which seems to be a limiting factor,
air has a low viscosity compared to water.

We have 3 parts, the Impeller, this can be a designed to work with Air or Water,
both is something I think is possible, but cavitation will be the major issue,
so a 3-dimension printed Impeller sould work for a Remote Controlled or RC vehical,
also known as Drones, which means the same thing as Remote Controlled, so use which term you like,
but you have to have an Impeller or a Propeller, but in this design,
we will only talk about the Impeller, the second part is the Motor, 
and the third part is the Frame.
